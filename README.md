# Idea
Coronavirus pandemic has immensely impacted students' studies all over the world. Schools are shut and students are stranded at home. This situation has left students in a lot of confusion and suspense.

Our idea is to help school students to clear any doubt by creating an interactive website where they can ask any doubt related to studies or career. Their questions can be answered by their peers or any teacher. Apart from that teachers themselves can share useful resources or material that can help student in this situation. Students and teachers can also get in contact with each other through a chat section.
